// Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.
// Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended.

const capitalizeWord = (x) => { return x[0].toUpperCase() + x.slice(1, x.length)}
